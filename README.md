## Brief description of Little Math Lab

1. Has we were put together as a team, we found common ground quickly beause of the fact of beign parents. 
2. This project idea helps fix present personal problems like preparing our child for preschool, where they will be tested for reading and basic math.
3. Little Math lab is designed to be friendly and engaging to children.
4. This lab is also designed to be improved, to add more dificult questions as the child grows
5. Or add questions of a diferent nature, example: reading and writing.
6. A great use of this program would be to find new problems in children school books and integrate them into our program.
